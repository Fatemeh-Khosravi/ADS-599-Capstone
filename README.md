### Overview
Medical diagnosis plays a critical role in providing effective healthcare, and advancements in technology have opened new avenues for improving diagnostic accuracy. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm, have demonstrated exceptional performance in image classification tasks. They have been successfully applied in various domains, including computer vision and medical imaging. In the field of medical diagnosis, CNNs have shown promising results in detecting and classifying abnormalities in medical images, such as identifying tumors in radiology scans. However, the accurate diagnosis of hemorrhages in brain CT scans remains a challenge. Hemorrhages can have severe consequences if not detected and treated promptly. Traditional diagnostic methods for hemorrhages rely on visual inspection by medical experts, which can be subjective and time-consuming. By leveraging the power of CNNs, we aim to develop a robust and efficient binary classification model capable of accurately identifying hemorrhages in brain CT scans. Such a tool could greatly enhance the diagnostic process, providing healthcare professionals with a valuable resource for prompt and accurate diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
